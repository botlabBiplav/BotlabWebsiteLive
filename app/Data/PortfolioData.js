    Title: "The Show Visuals",
    description:
      "The show design drew from the client’s ongoing campaign for consistency across international activations. The narrative seamlessly transported spectators from history to modernity, and from Ayodhya to the world as spiritual motifs like Lord Ram’s visage and the Ayodhya temple reformed into spectacular drone formations of landmarks from across target locations, evoking nostalgic connections to NRIs’ hybrid Indian and global identities. Finally, the persuasive call for Indians to return home was accompanied by a life-like portrait of Amitabh Bachchan, the brand ambassador of The Sarayu.",

      "Our expert production team delivered a video ad documenting the show to the client within 2 days. We filmed audience testimonials, operated filming drones to collate multiple angles for video production, scripted the video, and interfaced with the voice-over artist for video narration. The result was a visually stunning video that captured both the high emotion and masterful artistry of the show, which the client posted across social media platforms.",

Drone light shows have tremendous potential as a guerilla marketing strategy characterised by high on-ground engagement even with minimal pre-marketing as well as significant online buzz within a 4 km radius due to a show’s high visibility.",subtitle3:"Drone light shows are the next step in experiential storytelling, and can both serve as an immersive showstopper bookending a cutting-edge campaign or as a stand-alone event creating a novel, high-impact brand activation."},
